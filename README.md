# Alert

Simple GTK application which pops up a message and won't close until you acknowledge it

## Why

zenity and other alert boxes are great, but if they pop up while I'm typing, they are dismissed by pressing Enter or Space, and you might never see the content

## Prerequisites

Must have GTK 2.0 libs installed

## Compile

```
make
```

## Install

Copy the compiled alert file which compile makes to your PATH somewhere.

## Running

```
alert "Go walk up and down the stairs"
```
